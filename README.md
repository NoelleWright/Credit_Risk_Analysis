# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis is to help Jill with different techniques on how to remodel machine learning to help with credit problems. The data was sampled by three different machine learnings models, Cluster Centroids, SMOTE, RandomOver Sampler, BalancedRandomForestSampler, and SMOTEENN to predict credit risk. The main utilization tool for this analysis was supervised learning because there is a labeled outcome. 

Results:

With the results, random sampling was used to determine the status of different loans with a high or low risk. With the OverSampling Random model, the accuracy score was 64%.

With the SMOTE oversampling model, the accuracy score was 66% which is larger than the OverSampling random model.

With the ClusterCentroids Model, there was an accuracy score of 54% which represents undersamping from each model.

With the combination mode, SMOTEENN, the accuracy score was 64%, which was still very low i comparison to the other mdoels. There was a low risk of 1% precision.

With the BalancedRandomForest Classifier Model, there was an accuracy of 78%, but with a precision marker between 0.04-1% which means there are many false positive with the results. <img width="498" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 7 48 48 PM" src="https://github.com/NoelleWright/Credit_Risk_Analysis/assets/118686588/a27cf868-49db-461c-bc3a-de813306bf13">

With the Easy Ensemble Classifier, the results were represented by 93% accuracy which is the largest from all of the models. <img width="423" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 7 51 34 PM" src="https://github.com/NoelleWright/Credit_Risk_Analysis/assets/118686588/68677382-3792-4d80-bf15-cc2d1b466f29">

With all of the machine learning models and the accuracy being sampled, the EasyEnsemble Classifier model showed the best precision and accuracy among all of the models. Because the rest of the models had lower precision and accuracy results, the models used would be hard to determine credit risk analysis for Jill.
